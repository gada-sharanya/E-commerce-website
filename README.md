***Shopify*** is a simple e-commerce platform where a user can login using email address and clients can post the products available at their store on the platform.
Users visist the platform and can view wide range of chlothes, accessories and add the desired ones in the shooping cart and place an order on the website. The sample website is hosted on the free domain "NETLIFY" for testing purpose.

The site is coded with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. An add-on of walk-thru is added to the website so that whenever a new user is visiting he/she is prompted with navigation across the website. 
The site is then integrated to with Google Analytics to store each and every user action on the webiste and with the help of Python libraries like matplotlib a ***"HEAT MAP"*** is generated to view the most visited pages of the website so that it can provoide the developer with an idea of how a user is behaving and what may lead to drop out from the website without buying which can help to enhance the website allowing the websites to complete thier order. Overall, heat map is used by the developer to enhnace the webpage UI to attract customers.
